# Home_Sales
#Home Sales Analysis with PySpark
#Overview
#This project uses PySpark to analyze a dataset of home sales. The analysis includes working with temporary tables, caching data for efficiency, running SQL and DataFrame queries, and partitioning the data for optimized storage.

#Requirements
#Python 3.10 or later
#PySpark 3.4.4
#Java JDK 11
#Jupyter Notebook
#Time module (for runtime calculations)
#Dataset
#The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (home_sales_revised.csv) stored in an AWS S3 bucket. It contains information about home sales, including price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, year built, and more.

#Schema
#The dataset has the following schema:

#id: string
#date: date
#date_built: integer
#price: integer
#bedrooms: integer
#bathrooms: integer
#sqft_living: integer
#sqft_lot: integer
#floors: integer
#waterfront: integer
#view: integer
#Notebook Contents
#1. Setup
#Installed PySpark and Java.
#Configured the SparkSession for the project.
#2. Data Loading
#Read data from the S3 bucket into a PySpark DataFrame.
#Verified the schema using printSchema().
#3. Temporary View Creation
#Created a temporary SQL view from the DataFrame.
#4. Analysis
#Performed various queries to calculate:
#Average price of homes based on specific conditions (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and square footage).
#Average price grouped by year built or view ratings.
#Filtered results for prices above a certain threshold.
#5. Caching
#Cached the temporary view to improve query performance.
#Verified caching status.
#Compared runtime with and without caching.
#6. Partitioning
#Partitioned the data by date_built and saved it as a Parquet file for efficient storage.
#7. Parquet Operations
#Read the Parquet file back into a DataFrame.
#Created a new temporary table from the Parquet data.
#8. Cleanup
#Uncached the temporary table and verified it was no longer cached.
#Key Commands and Functions
#DataFrame Operations: Filtering, grouping, aggregation (groupBy, agg, round, etc.).
#SQL Queries: Executed SQL directly on the SparkSession using spark.sql().
#Caching: Used cache() and isCached() to manage and verify caching.
#Partitioning: Wrote data in Parquet format with partitioning using partitionBy.
#How to Run
#Clone or download the notebook file (Home_Sales_colab.ipynb).
#Install the required libraries and set up your environment (Java, PySpark).
#Run each cell sequentially to replicate the analysis.
#Expected Outputs
#Analytical results based on filtering and grouping operations.
#Comparison of runtimes for cached and uncached queries.
#A partitioned Parquet file optimized for storage.
#Future Improvements
#Handle missing or invalid data more robustly.
#Integrate visualizations for deeper insights into the data.
#Explore additional machine learning tasks using PySpark MLlib.
